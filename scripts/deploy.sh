# Plexus deploy verb — § 7 PLX. A stateless procedure, not a system:
#
#   ssh → docker compose pull → compose run --rm migrate (if declared) → docker compose up -d
#       → poll /healthz → on failure: re-up the previous image, exit non-zero
#
# Migrations are an artifact capability, not a host toolchain: an app that has
# them declares a one-shot `migrate` service in compose.yml (same image, migrate
# command, `profiles: ["migrate"]` so plain `up` never starts it). The host
# needs nothing but docker.
#
# State lives in git (compose.yml, placed on the host by the
# tenant's Ansible) and in the registry (the image). "Which version is live" is the
# running container's image, queried from `docker` (reality) — never a file we own.
# No persistent state, no daemon, no UI, no reconciliation loop.
#
# Degradation test — hand-runnable with no extra machinery:
#   ./deploy.sh deploy@1.2.3.4 plexus-website ghcr.io/org/plexus-website:<sha>
